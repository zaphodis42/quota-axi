# quota-axi

${DESCRIPTION}

You do not need quota-axi installed globally - invoke it with \`npx -y quota-axi\`.

quota-axi is data only: it never routes, recommends a provider, model, harness, credential, or
route, proxies, intercepts, logs in, imports browser cookies, or mutates provider state. Default
output has no ordering preference. The explicit \`models --sort runway\` comparator only orders
quota evidence, preserves ties, and is never a recommendation. It reads local provider auth sources and calls
first-party provider quota, usage, billing, or entitlement endpoints; it never launches the
Claude, Grok, Pi, or Kimi CLIs, so it cannot spend the quota it measures.

## When to use

Use quota-axi whenever you need local quota headroom before deciding whether it is safe to
keep working on a provider, when the user asks about usage, rate limits, or remaining quota,
or when comparing supported local provider headroom side by side.

## Workflow

1. Run \`npx -y quota-axi\` for compact TOON output covering supported providers' quota windows.
2. Scope to one provider with \`--provider claude\` or to a subset with
   \`--provider cursor,copilot,grok,kimi,zai-coding-plan\`.
3. Pass \`--json\` for the normalized machine-readable model instead of TOON. Read
   \`quotaSemantics.effectiveAvailability\` rather than treating a model window in isolation:
   account windows can bound every model, and \`boundedBy\` names every window included in the
   effective percentage. Read \`effectiveAvailability[].runway\` first for completion-risk evidence
   across every authoritative bound: \`projected_exhaustion\` supplies the earliest finite
   \`usableRunwaySeconds\`, \`projectedExhaustedAt\`, limiting window, and confidence; \`through_reset\`
   deliberately has no synthetic deadline; \`exhausted_now\` is zero runway; and \`unknown\` names
   unmeasurable bounds instead of inventing a conclusion. Read each window's \`pace\` (and the
   effective scope's pace summary) for diagnostics. Default TOON omits raw numeric reserve;
   \`--json\` and \`--full\` retain it. If relationship status is \`partial\` or \`unknown\`, do not infer
   one. Stale reports keep raw windows for diagnostics, but effective availability, pace, and
   runway are always unknown; never route from a stale raw percentage as though it were current
   headroom. Default output has no ordering preference. For a provider-native model evidence join,
   use \`npx -y quota-axi models --intelligence high --json\`. This catalog covers Claude, Codex,
   Grok, and Kimi only; its buckets are coarse editorial classifications, not scores. Its response
   includes catalog provenance and unmatched model windows. \`--sort runway\` is an explicit,
   documented quota-evidence comparator, not a provider, model, harness, credential, or route
   recommendation; inspect \`sort.tieGroups\` rather than treating equal evidence as a preference.
4. Pass \`--full\` to include account identity, per-source attempts, and raw reserve diagnostics.
5. Run \`npx -y quota-axi auth\` to check local auth-source availability without printing
   secret values.
6. On macOS, Claude Keychain value reads are pinned to the same validated current-user account
   Claude Code selects and are skipped by default until the user grants access once.
   If quota output reports \`reason: keychain_access_required\`, tell your user to run
   \`quota-axi --allow-keychain-prompt\` once and approve Keychain access ("Always Allow").
   After that successful grant, plain \`quota-axi\` calls reuse the existing Keychain access
   marker, scoped to both profile and account, to refresh live Claude quota without requiring
   the flag. Legacy markers are not reused, so an upgrade may require this one-time grant again.
7. For Grok, read \`state.authStatus\` before any logout wording. \`expired_refreshable\` means a
   local session still looks signed in but short-lived access expired. Only when quota-axi also
   emits \`reason: credentials_expired\` / \`remedyCommand: grok\` should you tell your user to
   open the Grok CLI once; Pi-only expiry has no Grok remedy because Grok cannot refresh Pi-owned
   credentials. Do not treat soft expiry as full sign-out, and do not ask quota-axi to refresh
   credentials - it never launches Grok or Pi or writes auth files. \`authStatus: usable\` with
   empty windows means model auth is present (Grok CLI and/or Pi \`xai\`) while consumer credit
   windows are unknown - not logged out. Reserve true sign-in recovery for
   \`authStatus: unusable\` / \`Grok sign-in required\`.
8. For a managed Codex installation, set \`QUOTA_AXI_CODEX_BINARY\` to its absolute executable
   path. quota-axi uses that exact executable for auth inspection and the read-only app-server
   fallback, and fails closed if the override is invalid. Codex OAuth availability follows the
   access token, not id_token expiry alone.
9. For Kimi, quota-axi prefers a literal Pi-managed \`kimi-coding\` API key from
   \`$PI_CODING_AGENT_DIR/auth.json\` (default \`~/.pi/agent/auth.json\`). If it is
   unavailable, quota-axi may reuse a fresh official Kimi Code CLI access token from
   \`$KIMI_CODE_HOME/credentials/kimi-code.json\` (default
   \`$HOME/.kimi-code/credentials/kimi-code.json\`) without refreshing or writing credentials.
   Grok also reads that same Pi auth file for an independent \`xai\` OAuth or literal API-key
   entry and treats Grok as usable when either the Grok CLI session or Pi \`xai\` credential is
   valid.
10. For Z.ai Coding Plan, quota-axi prefers a Pi-managed \`zai\` entry from
    \`$PI_CODING_AGENT_DIR/auth.json\` (api_key or unexpired oauth access token, never refreshed),
    then falls back to a literal \`ZAI_API_KEY\` environment variable. The plan's \`five_hour\` and
    \`weekly\` windows jointly bound every model; the monthly MCP/web-tool window is reported
    separately and never narrows model availability. The endpoint always answers HTTP 200, so an
    auth failure is read from the response envelope, not the HTTP status; an empty, unparseable,
    or limit-less success body reports a fresh snapshot with no windows rather than invented
    percentages.

## Usage

## Tips

- Output is TOON-encoded and token-efficient by default; pass \`--json\` only when you need
  the normalized schema.
- Exit code 0 means at least one provider returned data (fresh or stale); exit code 1 means
  every provider failed; exit code 2 means a usage error.
- Percentages are not comparable across providers - quota-axi never claims one provider's
  percentage equals another's.
- Claude \`--full\` output exposes the authoritative OAuth profile \`account.uuid\` as
  \`account.accountId\` when Anthropic returns one; otherwise the account identity is explicitly
  marked unverified rather than inferred.
- The quota cache at \`~/.cache/quota-axi/quotas.json\` only ever holds normalized
  non-secret snapshots.
  Fresh provider reports with no windows clear stale provider snapshots instead of caching
  empty quota.
  Claude local expiry metadata is advisory when an access token exists: the existing read-only
  usage request decides validity. Missing or invalid credentials without a usable token and HTTP
  401/403 retire Claude cache; only transient failures may use bounded, reset-pruned stale data.
  The Claude Keychain access marker lives alongside it, is scoped by hashed profile and
  account hashes, and contains no credential values or raw account name.
