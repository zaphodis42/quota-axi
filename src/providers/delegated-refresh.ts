/**
 * Delegated credential refresh.
 *
 * quota-axi never mints or rotates an OAuth credential itself, and never
 * performs a refresh-token exchange over HTTP. The reason is empirical: the
 * refresh tokens behind these stores rotate on use. Refreshing `~/.codex/auth.json`
 * out of band was observed to replace both the access token and the refresh
 * token, which would leave the vendor's own copy holding a spent refresh token
 * and force the user to sign in again. A quota reader must never be able to
 * sign a user out of the harness it is measuring.
 *
 * So only when the same stored access token is expired, has a refresh token
 * beside it, and is empirically rejected, quota-axi runs the vendor's own
 * smallest non-interactive command - the one that already owns rotation and
 * already owns the credential store - and then re-reads the refreshed access
 * token from the store the vendor just rewrote. quota-axi
 * reads the result; the vendor performs the rotation.
 *
 * The delegate contract, enforced here:
 *
 * - fixed argv resolved through `PATH` (or an absolute provider override).
 *   Delegates are declared in code, never assembled from provider responses,
 *   configuration, or user input, and never run through a shell. Deliberately
 *   shell-free resolution means a PATH-resolved Windows `.cmd` or `.bat` shim
 *   cannot run; that delegated attempt fails and the provider falls back to
 *   its existing read-only report and advice. The no-shell guarantee is never
 *   weakened to work around this accepted platform degradation.
 * - no interactive surface: the child gets no stdin (so a vendor TUI or prompt
 *   exits instead of waiting), `TERM=dumb`, and the vendor's own documented
 *   "do not open a browser" environment variables.
 * - a bounded wall-clock budget that quota-axi waits out but never enforces
 *   with a signal. The delegated command is the vendor performing a single-use
 *   OAuth refresh-token exchange against its own credential store; killing it
 *   part way through can leave that store holding a spent token, which is the
 *   very sign-out this whole design exists to avoid. So the budget bounds how
 *   long quota-axi waits, not how long the vendor may run: on expiry quota-axi
 *   detaches and reports the refresh as unconfirmed, and the caller falls back
 *   to a read-only report rather than pretending the run either succeeded or
 *   definitively failed. The child is spawned in its own process group for the
 *   same reason, so a Ctrl+C aimed at quota-axi (a live `--tui`, most of all)
 *   cannot land on a vendor mid-exchange either.
 * - the child's output is discarded at the operating system, not read.
 *   Credentials are never parsed out of vendor output; the refreshed value only
 *   ever comes from re-reading the vendor's own store. Owning no pipe also
 *   means a detached vendor can never block on one quota-axi stopped draining.
 * - at most one delegated refresh per credential source per quota read, which
 *   each caller enforces by delegating only on its single recovery path. It is
 *   deliberately per read rather than per process, so a long-running `--tui`
 *   still recovers from a session that expires while it is up.
 *
 * Only providers whose vendor CLI has an established non-interactive rotation
 * command get a delegate. Providers without one stay read-only and keep their
 * existing honest advice.
